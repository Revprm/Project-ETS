            There’s no place like home row, am I right? “ASDF" and "JKL:” aren’t just the keys our fingers rest upon, they’re our friends. Fine, that may be a bit much, but we have all undoubtedly come a long way from typing our very first letters. In my earliest days of typing, the keyboard setup was confusing and random despite all the fun games on my Typing Instructor CD-ROM.

    <p class="px-5 py-1">Eventually, navigating the layout became second nature, and here I am today, typing at reckless speeds without so much as needing to look down. Seven-year-old Devin would be quite impressed. It’s probably safe to say that many of us don’t know much about what lies beyond the standard QWERTY keyboard. But there’s so much more. So much.</p>
    <p class="px-5 py-1">Let’s take a look at some popular and regional keyboard layouts. They probably won’t have you switching anytime soon, but it’s worth a peek. The more you know, and all that.</p>
    <p class="px-5 py-1"><b>Dvorak</b></p>
    <p class="px-5 py-1">Don’t go looking for "Dvorak" spelled out on the layout like I did - it’s the name of the guy who patented it in 1936, August Dvorak. He felt that QWERTY was a pain to use and developed his layout to be more efficient. Studies seem to agree and maybe that’s because when using Dvorak, 70 percent of strokes are on home row (vs. 32 percent when using QWERTY.)</p>
    <p class="px-5 py-1">When using Dvorak, you’ll notice that more than half of your strokes are with the right hand. Dvorak did this on purpose, based on the fact that most people are right handed. Interesting note (at least to nerdy writers): All the vowels are in home row.</p>
