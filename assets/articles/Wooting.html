            Despite the current state of the hardware market amidst a crypto mining craze and a global chip shortage, PC gaming is still an incredible way to experience the latest titles; provided you can find components or a pre-built machine at a decent price. PCs are often more powerful (though next-gen devices are challenging this somewhat) and versatile than their console siblings, thanks to mod support for many popular games, the ability to use whatever input device you please: be it a keyboard, a standard gamepad, or even both at the same time, if you happen to own one of Wooting's devices.

    <p class="px-5 py-1">Wooting is a company that is best known for making highly-customizable analog mechanical keyboards. But what is an analog keyboard, exactly? A device that seeks to bridge the gap between controllers and keyboards by allowing users to experience the same smooth, gradual movement that a joystick can provide. This technology has its quirks – which we'll get to later – but overall, it holds a lot of promise for gamers that don't want to sacrifice the precision of a normal keyboard just to use a controller. Of course, even with an analog keyboard, there are still distinct reasons you might use a controller (a simpler button layout, for one), but Wooting's devices seek to at least reduce the number of times you have to swap between input methods.</p>
    <p class="px-5 py-1">We've covered Wooting's work in the past: I reviewed the original Wooting one for TechSpot way back in 2018. If you don't feel like reading a 4-year-old piece, in summary, I had high praise for the device overall. It had good build quality (a surprise for a product from a fledgling company) and the Wooting community was one of the most helpful I've had the pleasure of interacting with. At the time, it was a small, tight-knit group of people that really believed in the 'mission' (if you will) behind Wooting, and they were quick to assist with any problems brought to the table.</p>
    <p class="px-5 py-1"><b>What is the Wooting two HE?</b></p>
    <p class="px-5 py-1">The Wooting two HE is the latest product in the company's line-up and the only one currently selling. Both the Wooting one and the standard Wooting two have ended their manufacturing runs. The two HE is a full-sized keyboard with high-quality PBT plastic keycaps, Wooting's proprietary Lekker switches (more on those in a moment), and fully-customizable RGB backlighting.</p>
    <p class="px-5 py-1">If you buy directly from Wooting, the whole package will run you $195, not including shipping or the optional wrist rest, which comes in Black or Midnight Blue and costs an extra $30. The keyboard is not currently available for immediate shipment, but you can pre-order it to secure a unit for the next manufacturing batch, with an estimated shipping window of April 2022. For the sake of disclosure, Wooting sent me a two HE at no cost for the purpose of this review.</p>
