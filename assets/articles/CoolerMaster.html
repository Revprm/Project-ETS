            Cooler Master is one of the first names that comes to mind when you think of groundbreaking PC hardware, from the original HAF X case to the Evo 212 CPU cooler. But the company has yet to make a splash in the mechanical keyboard market.
            The Cooler Master CK720 is a 65-percent mechanical keyboard that comes ready to go with double-shot PBT keycaps, a sound-dampening silicone pad, and a hot-swappable PCB with 5-pin switch support. It also features per-key RGB, surprisingly good plate-mount stabilizers, flip-up feet, and a rotary knob. The CK720 is available in “space gray” with black keycaps or “silver white” with white keycaps and retails for a reasonable $100, but will it land a spot on our best keyboards page? Let’s find out.

    <p class="px-5 py-1">The Cooler Master CK720 is a hot-swappable mechanical keyboard with a 65-percent layout featuring highly-adjustable RGB, a rotary knob, and silicone padding for noise dampening. The 65-percent footprint is showing up more in the mechanical keyboard market because of its smaller size — which is still practical, thanks to the inclusion of arrow keys. </p>
    <p class="px-5 py-1">This is Cooler Master’s first attempt at creating an enthusiast board. The CK720 is a bit longer than other 65-percent boards, measuring 13.15 inches (334mm) long by 4.65 inches (118mm) wide by 1.46 inches (37mm) tall.  By comparison, the HyperX Alloy Origins 65 is 12.4 inches (315mm) long, while the Meletrix Zoom65 is 12.8 inches (325.12mm) long. The CK720 is a little longer than the Drop Sense75, which is 13 inches (330.2mm) long — and the Sense75 is (as the name suggests) a 75-percent layout keyboard. I didn’t necessarily find this extra length to be an issue, but if you’re looking at a 65-percent keyboard to save space, just know that this is not the most compact 65-percent keyboard on the market.</p>
    <p class="px-5 py-1">This extra space allows for some separation between the arrow keys and the navigation keys, which gives you a less-cramped layout than smaller boards (such as the Alloy Origins 65). There’s also a metal, clickable volume knob in the upper right corner. I liked this wheel a lot because it was notched for precise adjustment and didn’t wobble around — and it was even configurable.</p>
    <p class="px-5 py-1">The bottom of the case is plastic and features two sets of flip-up feet, which angle the keyboard up an extra three or five degrees (the wedge-shaped case has a default angle of five degrees). Combined with the silicone padding in the case, the plastic bottom provides a deeper sound to each keystroke, which I enjoyed. </p>
