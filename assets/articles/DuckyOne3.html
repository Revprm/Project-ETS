            Choosing a new keyboard is not easy. The array of available options is overwhelming, with several key factors to consider. What will its primary use be? How much are you willing to spend? Are there any essential features you're seeking? These considerations signify that the 'perfect' keyboard isn't the same for everyone. The Ducky One 3 SF Aura might not be the perfect keyboard for me, but it's the closest any has ever come.

    <p class="px-5 py-1">While I spend a lot of time gaming, my main consideration when it comes to a keyboard is how good it is for typing. Over the years, I've experimented with different models and a variety of switches. However, I had never used a Ducky, despite their reputation for being great for typists and the constant appearances in 'Best Keyboard' lists. Why? Somewhat shamefully, I just didn't think they looked that good.</p>
    <p class="px-5 py-1">The Ducky One 3 SF Aura doesn't come with as many elaborate extras as the Asus ROG Azoth wireless keyboard, but then its $140 price compares very favorably to Asus' $250 monster, and it still offers more than some rivals: 12 alternate keys, including a very snazzy spacebar; a switch puller, a keycap remover, USB-C to USB-A cable, and the obligatory stickers.</p>
    <p class="px-5 py-1">This keyboard is a small-form-factor (65%) version of the One 3 Aura, which means you still get the arrow keys, Del, PgUp, and PgDn - it's also available in standard, TKL, and Mini (60%) sizes. The unique design comprises a frosted plastic translucent body and translucent switches, letting you see the yellow foam that dampens the keystrokes, along with some of the dual-layer PCB, from the sides.</p>
