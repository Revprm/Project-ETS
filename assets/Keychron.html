            Prime Day deals are flooding in for Amazon's October sales event, with discounts on a huge range of tech, from vacuum cleaners to games consoles. The Keychron K2 V2 mechanical gaming keyboard is currently 20% off at Amazon, exclusive to Prime members. That's the joint lowest price we've ever seen it, and you can take it from me that this keyboard is definitely worth scooping up if you're in the market for a new set of keys. Why take it from me? Because I own one and absolutely love it. In fact, I'd say it's easily the best mechanical keyboard I've owned.

    <p class="px-5 py-1">A few months ago, after my Corsair K60 mechanical keyboard broke, I decided to take a punt on smaller manufacturer Keychron. I bought the K2 V2, which had decent reviews online. And oh boy, do I love this keyboard.</p>
    <p class="px-5 py-1">I don't actually own the exact model linked above, and instead own the slightly cheaper non-hot-swappable version, which means I can't easily change the switches. If you don't care about changing switches, the non-hot-swappable version is also 20% off at Amazon. I'd definitely recommend the hot-swappable version, as it gives you the opportunity to customize your switches later down the line. But apart from that, and the color of the keycaps, they're the same keyboard.</p>
    <p class="px-5 py-1">My love for the K2 springs from numerous sources. Firstly, it looks and sounds great. It's clean and classic looking, but has customizable LEDs underneath the keys. Unlike many LED keyboards I don't find the lighting looks tacky at all. I have it set up to produce a gentle wave of pale turquoise light after each keypress, which looks awesome (especially in the dark). The Gateron Red switches (Blue and Brown are also available) sound great too — with the default keycaps, they produce a nice light clack, which is satisfying but un-intrusive when I take the keyboard into the office. On that note, as a 75% it's super small and lightweight, it fits easily into my work bag.</p>
    <p class="px-5 py-1">Don’t go looking for "Dvorak" spelled out on the layout like I did - it’s the name of the guy who patented it in 1936, August Dvorak. He felt that QWERTY was a pain to use and developed his layout to be more efficient. Studies seem to agree and maybe that’s because when using Dvorak, 70 percent of strokes are on home row (vs. 32 percent when using QWERTY.)</p>
    <p class="px-5 py-1">The aluminum keyboard base results in a premium feel, despite the modest pricetag. And while there were some complaints online from owners of the original Keychron K2 V1 about firmware issues and general quality control, in my experience those haven't carried through to the V2 version on sale here. I've experienced no software, firmware or compatibility issues, and very little in the way of stuttering or missed keystrokes — it's certainly been better in all those regards than my much more expensive Corsair K60.</p>
