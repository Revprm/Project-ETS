            What would you buy if you had $250 to spend on something PC-related? A second-hand RTX 2060? A high refresh-rate 1440p monitor? How about an Intel Core i7-12700KF? Alternatively, you could blow the lot on the ROG Azoth, a wireless 75% keyboard from Asus.That's quite a price tag for any keyboard, but then the Azoth isn't just any keyboard.
            The Asus ROG Azoth has plenty of features that make it stand out from a crowded market: a silicon gasket mount, tri-mode connectivity, hot-swappable switches, and a lube kit. But the highlights for many people will probably be the tiny OLED display in the corner and the fact it's one of those rare keyboards that are great for both typing and gaming.

    <p class="px-5 py-1">Before buying my much-loved Razer Huntsman Elite, I owned a tenkeyless keyboard for quite a while, so I'm used to these small form factors. But I was surprised to see that the Azoth is even smaller than I expected (12.83 inches in length), squeezing four dual-functional navigation keys into one column on the right and the arrow keys beneath.</p>
    <p class="px-5 py-1">From the moment you open the box, everything about the ROG Azoth screams luxury, from the Apple-like packaging to the soft cotton cloth covering the keyboard itself. The first thing you're likely to notice is just how heavy and well-made the keyboard feels­; at 2.6 pounds, it's virtually the same weight as the Huntsman Elite.</p>
    <p class="px-5 py-1">That's no bad thing as this little keyboard is so sturdy that you could use it as a weapon. It's premium build quality, enhanced by a cold-to-the-touch metal top plate and durable doubleshot PBT keycaps.</p>
    <p class="px-5 py-1">Charging the Asus Azoth is done via the included 6.5-foot braided USB-C to USB-A cable. Once juiced, it can be linked to a PC via Bluetooth or 2.4GHz wireless by removing the tiny receiver that sits neatly inside the keyboard and plugging it into a spare USB-A port. You can also use a wired connection, of course.</p>
    <p class="px-5 py-1">There are plenty of features in the Azoth that make it compelling, though the 2-inch OLED panel in the corner will likely be the one that makes friends go, "Oooo!" Using Asus' Armory Crate software – which is the worst part of this experience – it can be programmed to show preset or uploaded custom animations/GIFs, banners with custom messages in a variety of styles and fonts, spectrum equalizers that kick in when music is played, or system information, which is my favorite.</p>
